.NET is a free, cross-platform, open source developer platform for building many different types of applications. Here you'll find content of all types here from how-to videos and blogs to quick starts and features reviews. We even have a [cookbook](/cookbooks/dotnet) with loads of helpful tips for developing enterprise solutions with both .NET and .NET Framework.

If you have any ideas or questions, you can reach out to our .NET focused developer advocate [Layla](/team/layla-porter) for assistance. Layla also hosts a chat show on Twitch called [.NET in the Wild](/tv/dotnet-wild) along with curating a .NET playlist on the [VMware Developers YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTZVwBSFhFM&list=PLAdzTan_eSPQm7gfKRNZYMG8t8c55LvkS).
